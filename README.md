# Medicare-Part-D-Claims-Segmentation-and-Anomaly-Detection
Did you know that the United States spends over $4 trillion annually on healthcare? Unfortunately, between 3% and 10% of this spending is lost to abuse, waste, and fraud. As I researched healthcare claims data, I discovered the staggering amount spent on prescription drug claims each year. There is a crisis of drug abuse and fraud, particularly with labeled drugs such as opioids, antibiotics, long-acting opioids, and antipsychotics for the elderly. This is a serious issue that not only hurts the health and well-being of individuals and society but also leads to higher costs for care and exorbitant financial losses for individuals and organizations.

When our aim is to identify suspicious claims, we face a problem: there is an overwhelming amount of healthcare data. Itâ€™s like finding a needle in a haystack. What we can do is to conduct claim segmentation and then identify suspicious claims. This way, we reduce the size of the search pool, cluster similar claims into groups, and make the anomaly detection task easier.
